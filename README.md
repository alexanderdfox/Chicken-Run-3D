Game Title: Chicken Run 3D: The Gordian Cluck

Story & Concept:

In Chicken Run 3D: The Gordian Cluck, you take control of a daring chicken trapped in a mysterious, alternate reality where the world operates like Flappy Bird. Caught in an ancient, cursed farm, your chicken must flap through dangerous mazes, booby-trapped barns, and labyrinthine ruins while dodging predators, solving ancient puzzles, and collecting mysterious relics. The ultimate goal is to escape, but every flap risks triggering traps, encountering hungry farm animals, or falling into perilous pits.

The Gordian Cluck is a legendary relic said to grant freedom to those who can master its power. But to claim it, you’ll need to survive the perilous obstacles and escape the increasingly challenging tombs of the farm world!

Gameplay Features:
	•	Flap Mechanic: Your chicken flaps its wings to ascend or avoid obstacles. With each tap, you guide your feathered hero through tight spaces, dodging the dangers of the world around you. Quick reflexes and constant flapping are key to survival!
	•	Endless Runner Meets Platformer: Experience side-scrolling action, where you’ll face rapid, reactive gameplay—dodge enemies, leap over traps, and outwit farm predators as you work your way through perilous levels.
	•	Relic Collecting: Discover ancient relics hidden throughout the tombs. These relics provide temporary boosts—like enhanced speed, bigger jumps, or shields—to help you survive more challenging segments and push you closer to escaping the farm world.
	•	Booby Traps & Obstacles: Classic Flappy Bird traps like spikes and walls combine with farm-themed hazards such as swinging scythes, collapsing floors, and foxes trying to make a meal of your chicken. Flap just the right amount to avoid each deadly trap!
	•	Challenging Boss Fights: At the end of each chapter, face off against powerful boss creatures, like massive farm beasts or mythical creatures guarding the Gordian Cluck. These bosses require fast, strategic thinking and precise flapping to defeat.

Visuals & Sound:
	•	Retro Meets Realism: A unique blend of colorful pixel art reminiscent of Flappy Bird with 3D rendered farm environments that bring the world of Chicken Run to life in a fun and quirky way. Picture your chicken navigating through a mix of ancient ruins, enchanted barns, and dangerous landscapes.
	•	Epic Soundtrack: A high-energy, adventurous soundtrack with quirky farm-style music keeps the action moving, while the classic Flappy Bird sound effects add nostalgia and excitement to each flap and jump.

Why It Would Be Great:
	•	The fast-paced flap mechanic creates a thrilling, addictive experience that keeps players on their toes, combining classic endless runner and platformer gameplay with a fresh twist.
	•	The challenge of avoiding traps, solving puzzles, and battling bosses makes for a deeply engaging game where every new level feels like an exciting challenge.
	•	The combination of fun, retro aesthetics with the adventure of relic hunting and tomb exploration offers a unique experience for fans of both platformers and endless runners alike.

Chicken Run 3D: The Gordian Cluck promises a high-flying, action-packed adventure that blends strategy, skill, and creativity—perfect for players looking for a fresh, fun, and exciting new game!
